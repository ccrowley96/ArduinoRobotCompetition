# Arduino Robot Competition
Arduino robot capable of taking a bluetooth signal to find one of three targets.  Once a target is found, the robot follows a line to the
target and picks up a ball with its robotic arm controlled by three servo motors.  It then returns to the origin, finds the 'basket', and
places the ball in the 'basket'.  The robot had 2 minutes to pick up as many balls as possible, given a sequence of targets by the professor.
